# SQL-Customer-Analytics

## Key Analyses Performed
### Customer Analytics (MySQL)
- Built a customer-level analytical dataset by joining users, orders, and order_items tables
- Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics to segment customers by value
- Identified high-value, loyal, and at-risk customers using purchase behavior
- Computed customer retention rate by distinguishing repeat vs one-time buyers
- Performed cohort analysis by signup month to track customer activity over time
- Aggregated transactional data to support customer lifetime behavior analysis
